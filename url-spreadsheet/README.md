url-spreadsheet

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Generate a spreadsheet or some type of table with urls that
are "clickable".  Allow the table to be easily edited in one
form or another.  And it should be easily viewable on all
commonly available operating systems.  And it must support urls
over 255 characters in length.

Possible Alternatives
---------------------

Microsoft .xls format is unacceptable for two reasons.  It cannot
support urls over 255 characters in length.  And it does not work
on all commonly available operating systems.

Libreoffice .ods format supports urls over 255 characters but it
does not work on all commonly available operating systems.

Markdown is easy to edit and can be converted to HTML for clickable
links.  But its tables are in HTML so it might be better to just use
HTML.

HTML is a little cumbersome to edit with all the tags but it is easy
to generate and the output is supported on all commonly available
operating systems.
